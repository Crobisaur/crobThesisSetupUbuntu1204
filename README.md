# crobThesisSetupUbuntu1204
This is a description (for myself) on how to seet up Ubuntu 12.04 with Caffe neural network framework &amp; python3.5 + packages for my thesis experiments.

1. First thing is to follow this guide here (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Install-Caffe-on-EC2-from-scratch-%28Ubuntu,-CUDA-7,-cuDNN%29) on how to install Caffe on Ubuntu 12.04
2. Next set up any IDE you wish to use, pycharm in my case
3. Next install python3.5 (http://askubuntu.com/questions/682869/install-python-3-5-on-vivid-using-apt-get)
4.    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install python3.5

5. Once all that is taken care of, install packages needed for thesis work:
6.  Numpy
7.  Scipy
8.  matplotlib
8.  sci-kit learn
9.  sci-kit image
9.  h5py
9.  pillow
10.  tiffile.py (only needed for reading in raw data files)
11.  
12.  This is as far as I've gotten.  Any changes will be posted as things progress.
